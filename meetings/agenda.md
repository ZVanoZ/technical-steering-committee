### Allow PHP-Assert along with Webmozart-Assert in Specific Cases

[Maximilian BÃ¶sing](https://github.com/boesing) wants to talk about the usage of `assert` (PHP) and `Assert` (Webmozart) when providing types for psalm.
In some cases, having runtime assertions may consume unnecessary opcodes just to provide proper psalm-types.

Lets assume the following code:

```php
$foo = sprintf('foo bar baz %d', 1);
assert($foo !== '');
```

Psalm is not able to verify that `$foo` is a non-empty-string, even though the first argument is a non-empty-string and therefore, the return value must either be `false` (in case of an error) or `non-empty-string`.

- https://psalm.dev/r/add6e2b321

Max prefers using `assert($foo !== '')` over `Assert::stringNotEmpty` to avoid redundant runtime checks which actually only have to be made to "make psalm happy".
As we do want to "make psalm happy", we can either use the `@psalm-var` inline-annotation, use `assert` or use `@psalm-assert` (as provided by webmozart `Assert`).

The first two options do not execute runtime checks (`assert` won't on production system as `zend.assertion` supposed to be `-1`). The webmozart assertion will execute assertions even though the assertion will always succeed.

Max prefers having `assert` over `@psalm-var` here, as it may fail in unit tests (or on non-production systems) and thus, the assertion will still be verified and not just assumed.

**Questions:**

- Do we want to use `assert` in some cases?
- If the answer to the first question was yes, how can we provide "rules" for doing so, so we can put these in the contributors guide?
- If the answer to the first question was no, do we want to require runtime `Assert` (webmozart) checks or do we accept inline `@psalm-var` annotations?

### Locked Dependencies for All Supported PHP Versions

[Maximilian](https://github.com/boesing) wants to talk about the current CI matrix.

Lately, we encountered some issues with different 3rd party libraries due to the fact that these are way more strict in dropping PHP versions along with major bumps.

This makes it almost impossible to have a `composer.lock` which will be valid for **all** PHP versions (`7.3`, `7.4`, `8.0` so far).

Some packages where it would be impossible to have a proper `composer.lock` for all supported versions (without dropping support for these versions and/or swapping to alternatives):

| Package | Major Version | PHP constraint
|---------|------------|--------
| [maglnet/composer-require-checker](https://github.com/maglnet/ComposerRequireChecker) | 2.x | `^7.2`
| [maglnet/composer-require-checker](https://github.com/maglnet/ComposerRequireChecker) | 3.x | `^7.4 \|\| ^8.0`
| [ocramius/package-versions](https://github.com/Ocramius/PackageVersions/) | 1.5.1 | `^7.3`
| [ocramius/package-versions](https://github.com/Ocramius/PackageVersions/) | 2.0 | `^7.4.7`
| [ocramius/package-versions](https://github.com/Ocramius/PackageVersions/) | 2.1 | `^7.4.7 \|\| ~8.0.0`

For `ocramius/package-versions` we already had to switch to `composer/package-versions-deprecated` to get some of our components up and running with the current matrix.
That's all due to the fact that we need one single `composer.lock` to fit for all PHP versions.
This will become more and more a problem when projects start to drop old PHP versions.

So we have two options:

1. drop support of PHP version as soon as 3rd-party libraries we are using drop support for these versions
1. only use `locked` dependencies for the stable version marked by the `dev.laminas.org` API which is requested in the matrix generation(?) and for all other versions, use `lowest` or `latest`

The latter will work with the [recent suggestions](https://gist.github.com/weierophinney/b003e50c3c2667d08076caf31ebd36a4) of [Matthew](https://github.com/weierophinney) regarding the migration to GHA.
That guide says:

> Using PHP 7.4, run composer update

So even though the component had support for PHP 7.3, some packages might be ended up having a `.laminas-ci.json` with these contents:

```json
{
    "exclude": [
        {"name": "PHPUnit on PHP 5.6 with locked dependencies"},
        {"name": "PHPUnit on PHP 7.0 with locked dependencies"},
        {"name": "PHPUnit on PHP 7.1 with locked dependencies"},
        {"name": "PHPUnit on PHP 7.2 with locked dependencies"}
    ]
}
```

This said, there should be no reason why we need `locked` dependencies for all PHP versions.

### Remove `laminas/laminas-zendframework-bridge` dependency from our packages

Over the past few weeks, we received multiple reports of people requesting us to drop `laminas/laminas-zendframework-bridge`
from our packages.

Our (TSC) response so far has been that we cannot do this until a new major version is released.
The reason for such a response is that people still rely on `Zend\` classes in their codebases, and therefore removal of `laminas/laminas-zendframework-bridge` could constitute a BC break for them, when a `laminas/` package substitutes a `zendframework/` one.

There may be a better solution to this though, which allows removal in a new **minor** release.

Here's an example for a hypotetical `laminas/laminas-xyz` package:

1. Remove the `{"replace": {"zendframework/zend-xyz": "self.version"}}` `replace`: block from `composer.json`:

   ```diff
   {
       ...
   -    "replace": {
   -        "zendframework/zend-xyz": "self.version"
   -    }
   }
   ```

2. Add a `conflict` with the old package in `composer.json`:

   ```diff
   {
       ...
   +    "conflict": {
   +        "zendframework/zend-xyz": "*"
   +    }
   }
   ```

3. Remove the `laminas/laminas-zendframework-bridge` dependency:

   ```diff
   {
       ...
       "require": {
           ...
   -        "laminas/laminas-zendframework-bridge": "^1.0"
       }
   }
   ```

4. Release under a new **minor** version (the `y` in `x.y.z`)

The proposed approach allows us to get a clean upgrade path for people that already use `laminas/*` packages, and already migrated away from the abandoned `zendframework/` packages.

People migrating from `zendframework/*` packages to `laminas/*` will still be able to use earlier **minor** releases of `laminas/*`, which we did release with the compatibility layer enabled.

### Require `GITHUB_TOKEN` permission to be explicitly specified in GHA workflow files

Permissions for `GITHUB_TOKEN` are [too broad and provide write access to a number of scopes](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#permissions-for-the-github_token) when action is run in a privileged context of a maintainer. Such privileged context is invoked, for example, on branch push event after the PR was merged. This poses a security risk in case of supply chain attack or vulnerability in invoked dependencies (eg [CVE-2021-29472 for Composer](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29472))

I propose to make [permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) field mandatory in all workflow files in all Laminas repositories with only required privileges specified for the specific workflow.

> ```yaml
> permissions:
>   actions: read|write|none
>   checks: read|write|none
>   contents: read|write|none
>   deployments: read|write|none
>   issues: read|write|none
>   packages: read|write|none
>   pull-requests: read|write|none
>   repository-projects: read|write|none
>   security-events: read|write|none
>   statuses: read|write|none
> ```
